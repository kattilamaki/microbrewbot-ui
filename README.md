# Simple UI for Untappd data

## About
Started project to access https://untappd.com public data through API. Running example could
be found from https://microbrewbot-ui.herokuapp.com.

## Installation

1. `npm install`
2. Set two variables to `.env` file: `REACT_APP_CLIENT_ID` and `REACT_APP_CLIENT_SECRET`
3. `npm run`

## Future
Untappd uses OAuth2 to identify users. There will be separate backend to manage
user authorization and do more that fetch data.
